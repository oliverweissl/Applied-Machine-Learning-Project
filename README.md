## Classifying Bird Species using a stacking approach.

To setup the environment follow the steps below:
1. create a `data` and `classifiers` folder for correct file-structure.
2. extract the `feathers-in-focus.zip` in the `data`folder.
3. Then run the numbered notebooks in order (e.g 1->2->3->...->n).

Notebooks without numbers or other py files are just auxiliary/ the underlying logical components.
